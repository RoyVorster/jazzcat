# Jazzcat

Just like [Rockstar](https://github.com/avinassh/rockstar) with a bit of added creativity. Jazzcat takes any text and turns it into commits to add some spice to your github contribution graph.

Example:
```
from jazzcat import jazz_it_up
jazz_it_up('ROY VORSTER', 1999)
```

Use at own risk.
